# Preparation 🎒

If you want to do well in the bootcamp it is best to come prepared. Students who have installed Linux, spent an hour learning python basics, and an hour learning git/command line bascis are much more likely to succeed and get a sweet job after the course.

# Foundations

> "When you don’t have a setup, there are many times when you get the inspiration, the idea, but you have no tools, no place to put it together. And the idea just sits there and festers. Over time, it will go away. You didn’t fulfill it—and that’s just a heartache." - [David Lynch](https://rhystranter.com/2016/02/22/david-lynch-on-having-a-setup/)
