# Final Projects

Bootcampers will spend a tremendous time working on final projects that are targeted to the bootcamper's career goals. For an example final presentation see [Oleh's Video (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-KL-mWF548) and [Oleh's Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project).
