# 🚀 **Final Project Sequence** 🚀

Participants will dedicate substantial time to final projects aligned with their ✨career aspirations✨. For an array of past presentations and source code, 📺 visit [Brad's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bradflaugher2452/videos).

### 🅰️ **Collect Data and Hack together a simple model (required)**
- Use the 🐍 [Medusa-ML Template](https://github.com/Medusa-ML/ML-Template)
- 📖 Create a synthetic text dataset via [Scikit-LLM](https://github.com/iryna-kondr/scikit-llm)
- 🔍 AND/OR discover an intriguing dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets)

### 🅱️ **Use your dataset, fit a custom model, make it compact, precise, and swift (optional)**
- (beginner) follow the [Tensorflow beginner quickstart](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) tutorial then make a [basic Tensorflow image classifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification) or a [basic text classifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification)
- (recommended) [60 Minute Pytorch Blitz](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html) then 📜 [PyTorch Text Classifier](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/text_sentiment_ngrams_tutorial.html) or [Pytorch Image Classifier](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html)
- (more advanced) [Fine-Tune a Pretrained Model for Classification with Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) - 📝 [Text](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sequence_classification) or 📸 [Images](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/image_classification)

### ⭐ **Challenge yourself, do more exploratory data analysis, combine datasets, experiment with varied modeling techniques (optional)**

- (advanced) use a cross-plafrorm framework like [keras_core](https://keras.io/keras_core/guides/)
- 🏆 (very advanced) [Replicate a Winning Model from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code?types=competitions)
