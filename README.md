Notes and resources for [Brad Flaugher's Data-Focused Programming Bootcamp](https://bradflaugher.com/bootcamp.html)


# New Student TODOs

* get access to course moodle at [moodle.bradflaugher.com](https://moodle.bradflaugher.com)
* get ssh access to ML training rig ```ssh myname@sekret.bradflaugher.com```

# Final Projects

Bootcampers will spend a tremendous time working on final projects that are targeted to the bootcamper's career goals. For an example final presentation see [Oleh's Video (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-KL-mWF548) and [Oleh's Repository (GitHub)](https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project).
