# Final Project Sequence

Participants will dedicate substantial time to final projects aligned with their career aspirations. For an example of a final presentation, check out [Oleh's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-KL-mWF548) and [Oleh's Repository](https://github.com/MorhaliukOL/ML_Project). For more presentations and source code, visit [Brad's Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@bradflaugher2452/videos).

## A: Collect Data and Hack together a simple model (required)
- Use the [Medusa-ML Template]
- Create a synthetic text dataset via [Scikit-LLM](https://github.com/iryna-kondr/scikit-llm)
- AND/OR find a cool dataset via [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets)

## B: Use your dataset, fit a custom model, make it small, precise and fast (optional)
- [Tensorflow Text Classifier Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification) or [Tensorflow Image Classifier Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
- [PyTorch Text Classifier](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/char_rnn_classification_tutorial.html) or [PyTorch Lightning Classifier](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/starter/introduction.html)
- [Fine-Tune a Pretrained Model for Classification with Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training) - [Text](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sequence_classification) or [Images](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/image_classification)

## C: Challenge yourself, do more exploratory analysis, try different modeling techniques
- [Replicate a Winning Model from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code?types=competitions)
