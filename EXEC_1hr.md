# Executive Summary (30mins-1hr)

# AI = Decision Making
* AI is primarily concerned with decision making
* Humans are OK at this, we're inconsistent and sometimes drunk, but overall we are OK.
* Computers have a mixed record too, but when given the right problem they are generally faster and more consistent. 

# GOFAI
* Good Old-Fashioned AI is rules-based AI that was used primarily from Super Mario Bros to Deep Blue.
* Deep Learning is basically programming with data that was used in OCR, Watson, Image Classification (AlexNet) and ChatGPT.

# AI Feeds on Data: Garbage in -> Garbage Out
* Don't get caught up in the mud of self-supervisd, transformers etc... (yet)
* Clear-headed thinking about inputs and outputs will get you far, just like back in statistics class

# Transfer Learning
* It's using knowledge from one domain to improve the performance of a new model.
* WE ARE ALWAYS TRANSFER LEARNING, from the past to the future, from one domain to another.

# Ubiquitous, Undetectable and Unembraced
* You will find AI generated content everywhere, today.
* You will not find it in most organizations

# Concept Drift / Half Life
* Concept drift gives every model a half life, the more the nature of problems change the faster the model performance degrades.

# Humans in the Loop
* The near-universal solution to all complaints about AI.
* Give people who didn't have any direct reports some AI to boss around.




# Other Ideas below...

# Concept Drift
* Concept Drift is how often the truth changes, how often does the model need to be retrained?
* Discuss: Language, Driving, Credit Scores, Admissions Criteria, What it means to write good code, Beauty, etc..

# Humans in the Loop
* The near-universal solution to all complaints about AI.
* Give people who didn't have any direct reports some AI to boss around.

# UI/UX
* ChatGPT is a UI/UX improvement on existing models, AI Dungeon came first btw.
* Tesla has a bad UI for "Full Self Driving" and that matters.

# Landmines
* impossible to keep humans at the loop in certain timescales, nuclear deterrents let's say. You're making a doomsday machine from strangelove, this is an exception to the humans in the loop rule though, don't get confused.
