## Hello World!

* I teach young "data-focused engineers" (aka Data Engineers or Scientists) at my [bootcamps](https://bradflaugher.com/bootcamp.html)
* I [invest in](https://ventures.nextfab.com/about/) and [contract for](https://inoxoft.com/) many startups (and occasionally big cos like Toshiba and P&G), either way I see many projects and sign many NDAs. 
* Proud, lifetime and supporting member of [ACM](https://www.acm.org/) and [FSF](https://www.gnu.org/thankgnus/2022supporters.html) and recovering former member of [W3C Future of Advertising Group (read about the drama)](https://www.protocol.com/policy/w3c-privacy-war).

## Mass Destruction and Paranoia

* Is work over?
* Will AI replace us?
* Should we be doing this?

## The Big 5

* **There is no magic, only math.** (Chapter 3) 
* **Engineering is what humans do.** Building tools that are stronger than us is what we do, it's not necessarily wrong or playing God or whatever. Don't give into the naturalistic fallacy or the is-ought fallacy. (Chapter 8)
* **Big complex systems are hard to explain and sometimes behave eratically**, even if they are theoretically fully explanable, that doesn't mean a judge and jury will understand them. (Chapter 3, 6, 7 )
* **If you can't tell I'm using an AI to do my job, you can't tell me not to use it to do my job** Good luck regulating this stuff, most of the time (self-driving excluded). (Chapter 4 and 8)
* **AIs don't kill people, people kill people** (Chapter 7)
* **BONUS: If you started out as a person with a secretary or a butler, having a digital personal assistant doesn't matter to you** (Chapter 8)
