# Data-Focused Programming
## Why and How

---

# What kind of work can we do?

* Stand-Alone Applications (Operating Systems, Databases, Games, Desktop Apps, Terminal Tools, "Offline" Native Apps, Static Websites)
* Front-Ends (JS Websites, PWAs, Connected Native Apps)
* Back-Ends (Server Code, Integrations)
* "Operations" (Devops, Security, QA)

---

# What did Brad learn how to do in school?

* 100% Stand-Alone Applications
* 0% Anything Else

---

# What do our clients ask for?

* 90% Back-Ends + Front-Ends (Python mostly, sometimes JS or .NET) + (React + Native or Flutter Fronts)
* 9% Front-Ends Only (integrating with existing backends)
* 1% Stand-Alone Applications (Static HTML+CSS pages)

---

# Principles

* Popular is good... but not everything
* Slow Tech wins in the long-run
* Integrations Pay over time
* Data is essential to business success
* Never pay a license fee... trust good communities

---

# Money is nice

* Data and AI Engineers are the most highly paid in the word right now... right after Managers and Devops [according to Stack Overflow Developer's Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#work-salary-by-developer-type-global)

---

# What we'll use and why

---

# Unix-Like Operating Systems 
## (Debian-Based Linux Mostly, Ubuntu) 

* It's popular
* It's free
* manages ~95% of the worlds server data

---

# Docker and Bash

* Helps us document our code (all of the dependencies are written out)
* makes it easy to share (anyone can run our scripts and get started)
* keeps it safe and secure (Silo's access to our servers and limits networking)
* They work on every operating system (including Macos and Windows)

---

# C, as needed
## Maybe Rust, too

* C was made in 1972, inspiration for many modern languages
* It's still incredibly popular and its (almost) the fastest language possible
* We can tell people who say "Python is slow" to get lost
* Plays well with everyone
* We'll use in the form of Numpy or Tensorflow mostly, almost never directly

---

# SQL
## Query the data

* Made in 1974
* Most data is structured
* SQL is how we get it

---

# PYTHON
## It's the glue

* It's flexible, popular, free and open
* The fastest language to develop in (you'll have to trust me)
* It plays well with others. Bash is hard to code in... so is C. Python glues together existing high-performance tools and libraries elegantly.

---

# Javascript
## OR Swift, Dart, Kotlin when we have to

* We need to display our data on Phones, Browsers (and rarely on desktop apps)
* Python and C are not built to display data
* Our customers use iPhones and Chrome... not the terminal :(

--- 

# What You'll Need

---

# Must Haves

* Docker
* Terminal/Shell
* Git
* Text Editor (I prefer simple editor to IDE)
* Web Browser

---

# What We'll Learn

---

# General Stuff

* Unix-like OS Basics
* Bash Basics
* SQL Basics

---

# Python + Data Deep Dive

* CSV and Excel Scripting
* Numpy and Pandas
* Pillow
* NLTK
* Tensorflow


---

# Group Projects

* Language, Numeric, or Image Models (in Tensorflow)
* Beautiful Soup and web scraping
* Deploy with Flask and Docker... hack some Javascript to display
* Deploy using tesorflow lite

---

# Guest Speakers

* Django
* Pytorch
* Tensorflow/ML Theory
* PrestoDb

# Asking For Help

* You need a reference library
* Senior developers use Google more!
* Ask friends
* Ask Brad
* Take a walk
* Don't give up!
