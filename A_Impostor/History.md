# Takeaways
* Unix philosophy works. Small tools do one thing well
* Data is Gold
* OS's and Browsers are both huge efforts, beyond scope of a single company or person
* Open Source is strong, on a grassroots level.
* Trust communities!
* Front Ends come and go. Lots of incentive for companies to make them easy... Back ends stick around a long time and are stickier...
* Old software dies hard (Windows, Costco using IBM, SAP)
* Open Source as a sustainable Saas solution?
* Golden Handcuff Problem and an open foundation as solution.
* Nowhere to hide. Stallmans struggle for personal computing. Even OpenBSD has Darpa funding
* Commodity Hardware and Drivers. cant have nice things and not pay... works for servers tho!!!
* Laptop tech hasnt changed... https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/12/how-and-why-i-stopped-buying-new-laptops.html

# My/Our Setup
* Browser plus Terminal Only (OS and Browser are too difficult to tackle as small dev shop)
* Documentation!!! Document and understand Dependencies
* Portable Code, Plan for platform change, Daddy is going to move away
* Leverage Open Source
* Use popular frontend tech, don't stress about rewriting... plan on it.
