# Step 1: Define the Task 🎯

---

## Collect a Dataset 📦
- Essential for training and evaluating models
```python
import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')
```

---

## Understand Your Data 🕵️
- Visualize, summarize, and explore
```python
data.head()
data.describe()
```

---

## Choose a Measure of Success 📏
- Define metrics to evaluate model performance
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
# ...
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_true, y_pred)
```

---

# Step 2: Develop a Model 🛠️

---

## Prepare the Data 🔄
- Preprocess and split the data
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# ...
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

---

## Choose an Evaluation Protocol 📋
- K-fold validation, split validation, etc.

---

## Beat a Baseline 📈
- Compare with a random or simple model
```python
# Assume baseline_model is a simple model
baseline_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, baseline_model.predict(X_test))
```

---

## Overfit, Then Regularize and Tune 🔄
- Address overfitting with regularization techniques
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
# ...
ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

# Step 3: Deploy the Model 🚀

---

## Communicate with Stakeholders 🗣️
- Explain model, set expectations

---

## Ship an Inference Model 🚢
- Deploy model to production
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 my_ml_model
```

---

## Monitor and Maintain 🛠️
- Track model performance, update as necessary

---

## Deep Learning Models 👓
- Large data-driven functions

---

## Key Features 🗝️
- Complex, unpredictable, sensitive to inputs
- Challenges in explanation and testing

---

## Data Scientists' Time ⏳
- Data collection, organization
- Limited experimentation, celebrate successes, highlight failures

---
